# Python Mouse Wiggler
Python script created using PyAutoGUI to simulate random mouse and keyboard movements...basically to stop screensavers, your PC going to sleep or to look "always" active aat work :-D

## About

Just a quick script for bantz and to practice my Python skillz.

## How to use

Literally just run the script using terminal or your IDE, and it will loop through until an error occurs..

To make and error and stop the script simply drag your mouse into the top-left hand corner of the screen.

## FAQs
Is this serious/Do you work somewhere that monitors your mouse movements?

No, it's just a bit of fun on a longstanding "joke" about looking busy at work by never going to inactive/away on chat software except for meetings/lunch.
